# capstone-dog

Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App
This notebook walks you through one of the most popular Udacity projects across machine learning and artificial intellegence nanodegree programs. The goal is to classify images of dogs according to their breed.

If you are looking for a more guided capstone project related to deep learning and convolutional neural networks, this might be just it. Notice that even if you follow the notebook to creating your classifier, you must still create a blog post or deploy an application to fulfill the requirements of the capstone project.

Also notice, you may be able to use only parts of this notebook (for example certain coding portions or the data) without completing all parts and still meet all requirements of the capstone project.
