Project: Write an Algorithm for a Dog Identification App.

This notebook walks you through one of the most popular Udacity projects across machine learning and artificial intelligence nano degree programs. The goal is to classify images of dogs according to their breed.

This might be just it if you are looking for a more guided capstone project related to deep learning and convolutional neural networks.
